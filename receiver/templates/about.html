            <p>
                Concerned with the drastic increase in Covid-19 Cases and deaths in India, Covid Patients are in search of Beds, 
                Oxygen Tanks, Blood & Plasma and there is no central hub where people can reach out for any help.
                The one in search of these resources fails to get them due to the lack of updated data and a lot of data that is 
                scattered over the social media platforms and other sources which cannot be easily accessed. To overcome this problem 
                we made this website to ensure that we can gather the required data which can be accessed by the needy in one place. 
                We aim to expand our network and help people with their requirements as soon as possible and also provide as much relevant 
                data as possible. If you want to join our network you can reach out to us at our Email ID provided below.
