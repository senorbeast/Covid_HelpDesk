            </h2><br>
            <p>
                Concerned with the drastic increase in Covid-19 Cases in India,
                Covid Patients are searching for Beds, Oxygen Tanks, Blood & Plasma
                and there is no central hub where people can reach out to for any help.<br>
                <br>
                if an individual needs a specific help, all the information and helps available are scattered on social media platforms or other sources, in
                case. To overcome this problem we made this website to ensure that we can gather the required data which can be accessed
                in one place.
                <br>
                If anyone is willing to help, the person can add their details. In case anyone is in urgent need, they
                can reach out to people via this platform.
